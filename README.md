# Request-Tracker-Bloomington

This project introduces a novel solution to the shortcomings of current visualization methods for Bloomington's service requests. Traditional visualizations lack engagement and flexibility, hindering user interaction. To address this, a unified dashboard is proposed, offering residents the ability to visualize various request types and their completion timelines. Through advanced visualization techniques, the user-friendly interface enables efficient exploration of request categories, tracking of completion times, and identification of trends. This innovative approach strives to enhance community engagement, transparency, and informed decision-making in Bloomington's service request management.
